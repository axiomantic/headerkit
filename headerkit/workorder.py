"""Tiered test generation: real tests where the IR knows the answer, failing stubs where it does not.

A scaffolded project's tests split three ways:

* **Tier 1** -- the IR fully determines both the call and the expected result, so a
  genuine passing test is emitted (struct field round-trip, unsigned bit-field
  bounds, enum value coverage). These are not work-order items.
* **Tier 2** -- the IR knows the *cases* but not the expectation, so a parameterized
  failing stub is emitted with one case per enumerator, per overload, or a NULL case.
* **Tier 3** -- pure semantics. One failing stub per remaining function.

Stubs fail loudly and carry their instruction at the point of failure, because a note
at the top of a file is skimmed and a message on the failing assertion is read. The
test run is the progress meter: a stub that has been written turns from red to green.

# Suggestions

These are ideas, not findings. headerkit did not analyse this library to produce
them; it emits the same list every time. Read them once against the generated
bindings, take what fits, and ignore the rest. Ignoring all of it is fine.

Look at the wrapped API and consider whether any of these would make it nicer to use:

- Iterators over function pairs shaped like `count`/`get` or `first`/`next`.
- A wrapper that scopes paired acquire/release functions, so callers cannot leak.
- A class or object wrapping an opaque handle together with its lifecycle functions.
- Mapping error-code return values onto the language's own error reporting.
- Async wrappers around polling or callback-based functions.
- Native string and sequence types in place of pointer-plus-length parameter pairs.
- Sets in place of enums whose values are powers of two.

# Agents

Instructions for AI coding agents working on `{package_name}`.

This project was scaffolded by HeaderKit from a C/C++ header. The bindings are
generated; the tests and wrappers are partly generated and partly outstanding.

## Outstanding work

`WORK_ORDER.md` (if present) lists tests that HeaderKit could not write automatically,
because they depend on what this library means rather than on what its header declares.
Every one of them is a test that fails right now, and each failure message carries its own instruction.

Run `{command}` to see the current test suite state.

**Before working through test stubs, ask the user whether they want that done.** It is
optional work, it can be large, and the user may have scaffolded this project only to
get the bindings. Do not start on it unattended.

## Invariants & Quality Standards

1. **Zero Tautological Assertions**: Never write or accept dummy assertions like `assert True` or bare prints. Tests must exercise real functions, types, and return values.
2. **Tripwire Preservation**: Tripwire tests verify that native dynamic libraries link and foreign C ABI symbols resolve at runtime. Never disable or hollow out tripwires.
3. **Regeneration Safety**: Re-running HeaderKit preserves `AGENTS.md`, `WORK_ORDER.md`, `SUGGESTIONS.md`, and existing test files. Only generated bindings modules are updated.
