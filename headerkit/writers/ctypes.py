    """Header-local spellings that resolve to something the module actually binds.

    A C type name can reach this writer in several spellings for one type, and
    which one arrives depends on the backend and on how the header wrote it.
    Both kinds of tag-spelled name are unusable as Python: ``enum E`` and
    ``struct Inner`` are two words. Neither can be repaired by a local rewrite,
    because whether a name resolves -- and to *what* -- is a property of the
    whole header, so it is answered once per header and carried in here.

    :param enums: Spellings that resolve to an integer ctypes type, mapped to
        that type. Only enums whose width this writer can establish are listed,
        and the type is per-enum rather than a constant: a declared underlying
        type decides it. See :func:`_enum_type_names`.
    :param records: Spellings that resolve to an emitted ctypes class, mapped to
        that class's name. Unlike an enum there is no default to fall back on --
        the answer is the class or nothing -- so a record this header does not
        declare is simply absent and keeps its C spelling.
    :param record_classes: The class name each record is *emitted* under, keyed
        by its qualified C++ name. Usually the tag itself; a record whose tag is
        contested gets a distinct name instead, so that both meanings of the
        contested spelling survive. See :func:`_record_type_names`.
    :param contested_records: Tags an ordinary identifier in this header also
        binds, mapped to the class the record was emitted under. Reached only
        through ``CType.is_elaborated``: the bare spelling of such a tag means
        the *other* declaration, so the two are told apart by how the use site
        was written rather than by the name, which is identical for both.
    :param scalars: Typedef names that resolve to a ctypes scalar, mapped to it.
        ``typedef unsigned char Level;`` renders as a comment and so binds no
        ``Level`` at all, which made every member declared ``Level v;`` a
        ``NameError`` -- with or without any collision. Resolving the name where
        it is *used* fixes that without inventing a module-level binding whose

        The answer is **measured, not modelled**. The class ctypes will build
        from these very tuples is built here, and its field descriptors are read
        back: ``offset`` gives the storage unit's byte and the high and low
        halves of ``size`` give a bit-field's width and its bit offset within
        that unit. Nothing is instantiated, so this cannot execute generated
        code or touch memory the layout engine got wrong.

        Modelling the allocator instead is what this replaced, and it could not
        be made right: ctypes has three bit-field algorithms -- the pre-3.14
        one, the gcc-sysv and MSVC ones it chooses between from 3.14, and the
        MSVC one it has always used on Windows -- and a model in the writer
        encodes exactly one of them. Asking the engine that will lay the record
        out is correct on all of them by construction, including for unions,
        whose members ctypes places correctly only from 3.14.

        Reported for the first name that disagrees; the record's own size and
        alignment count as a disagreement too, attributed to the first field so
        the diagnostic always names something the reader can look at.

        **What this cannot catch.** ``packed_c_layout`` models the emitted
        spelling and ``_measure_ctypes_layout`` measures the emitted spelling;
        this compares the two. An error made while *choosing* the spelling -- a
        pad of the wrong width, a carrier that should not have been narrowed --
        is written into both sides and cancels out, so the comparison is blind
        to it by construction. This catches a spelling ctypes lays out
        differently from C. It cannot catch a spelling that is the wrong
        spelling, and no amount of agreement between these two is evidence
        about that. Only a compiled C probe is.

        That is not hypothetical: a zero-width unnamed bit-field computed its
        fill from the natural running offset rather than the packed one, and
        sixteen shapes were generated at the wrong size with nothing reported,
        because both sides of this comparison agreed on the wrong pad.

    """The ctypes spelling for ``decl``, or None when this writer cannot size it.

    This is the size and signedness of every value of the enum that crosses the
    ABI, so a wrong answer here is a wrong answer everywhere the type appears --
    and one that *imports cleanly*, since a member of the wrong width is still a
    valid member. Refusing is the only safe alternative to knowing.

    Three sources of truth, in order:

    0. **Whether the parser could see the clause at all.** ``underlying_type``
       is ``None`` both when the header declared none and when the grammar could
       not represent what it declared -- tree-sitter's C grammar has no
       production for ``enum E : long long``. ``underlying_type_known`` separates
       the two, and an unknown width is refused rather than inferred from the
       enumerators, which would size that enum at four bytes against a real
       eight.
    1. **The declared underlying type.** C++11 lets any enum fix it, scoped or
       not -- ``enum class E : unsigned char`` and ``enum E : unsigned long long``
       both do -- and it is the only thing that decides the width when present.
       It cannot be reconstructed from the enumerators, which constrain the
       width from below and say nothing about a type chosen to be wider. If it
       names something this writer has no ctypes spelling for, that is a refusal
       rather than a guess.
    2. **No enumerators and no declared type.** There is nothing to reason from,
       so it is refused. Two different headers arrive here and the IR does not
       tell them apart: an *opaque* declaration (C's ``enum E;``, C++'s
       ``enum class E;``), where refusing is right, and a *complete* empty-body
       enum (C++'s ``enum E {};``, whose underlying type is ``int`` and whose
       ``sizeof`` is 4), where refusing is over-conservative. Both reach this
       function as ``values=[] underlying_type=None`` on both backends.

       Refusing both is the safe direction -- the cost is a loud failure on a
       header that could have been sized, not a wrong width on one that could
       not -- and separating them needs the IR to record that a body was present,
       which it does not. The arm is load-bearing regardless: without it the loop
       below runs zero times and returns ``ENUM_CTYPE`` by vacuous truth, a
       four-byte answer produced by having examined nothing. An earlier revision
       shipped exactly that and sized ``enum Fwd : long long;`` as ``c_int``
       against a real eight bytes. No *execution* gate covers it, because a C
       member of an incomplete enum does not compile and the C++ empty-body case
       is precisely the one this refuses; it is pinned by unit assertion instead.
    3. **The enumerators.** With no declared underlying type, C requires only
       that the type represent every enumerator, and every ABI headerkit targets
       uses an int-sized type where they all fit in one. A value the IR does not
       record as an integer -- a string, where a backend left an initialiser
       unevaluated, or ``None`` -- is not something to guess about either.

    A scoped enum is *not* special-cased. C++ fixes its underlying type to
    ``int`` when the header does not, so rule 3 answers it correctly; an earlier
    revision refused every scoped enum and still resolved the unscoped
    ``enum E : unsigned long long`` wrongly, because ``is_scoped`` was never the
    property that mattered.

    """Every enum spelling this header can resolve, mapped to its ctypes type.

    An enum binds no ctypes class, so a use of one has to be recognised from the
    type's name and rewritten to the integer it is represented as. Three
    spellings reach this writer for the same enum and all are collected, because
    which one arrives depends on the backend and on how the header spelled it:
    the tag form ``enum E``, the bare form ``E`` (tree-sitter reduces every
    reference to it, and a typedef produces it under either backend), and the
    qualified form ``n::E`` for an enum inside a C++ namespace.

    **Only enums :func:`_enum_ctype` can size appear here.** One it cannot keeps
    its C spelling, which does not import -- a loud failure rather than a member
    of the wrong width that imports and computes wrong answers across the ABI.

    Two shadowing rules keep the bare form from over-reaching. A tag and an
    ordinary identifier are separate namespaces in C, so ``enum Tone { ... };``
    and ``typedef struct { ... } Tone;`` are both legal in one unit and an
    unprefixed ``Tone`` is the *record*; treating it as the enum would retype an
    eight-byte record as a four-byte integer. Any name a record or a non-enum
    typedef binds is therefore withheld, and a tag-less ``typedef struct`` is
    looked for under both kinds: it reaches this writer as a ``Struct`` carrying
    the alias as its name, with no ``Typedef`` node of its own.

    A spelling two declarations disagree about is dropped rather than resolved
    to whichever came last -- ``namespace a { enum E : char ... }`` beside
    ``namespace b { enum E : long long ... }`` leaves bare ``E`` meaning two
    different widths, and there is no answer to give.

    Withholding a name a ``Typedef`` binds is the arm no execution gate covers,
    because the shape that reaches it -- ``typedef struct ToneRec Tone;`` next to
    ``enum Tone`` -- cannot be scaffolded into an importable module today. Two
    separate unfixed defects in this writer stand between that header and a
    gate, both about *records* rather than enums:

    1. a record alias renders via :func:`_typedef_to_ctypes` into the
       ``typedefs`` section, which ``_SECTION_ORDER`` emits *after* ``structs``,
       so a record using the alias raises ``NameError`` at import;
    2. records are emitted in declaration order rather than dependency order.

    Whoever closes either of those should come back and gate this arm. It is
    kept meanwhile because dropping it does not restore that module, it only
    changes how the module fails: the member becomes a four-byte integer where C
    laid out an eight-byte record, so the package imports and computes wrong
    answers instead of raising.

    A bare name whose enum is declared in *another* header is not resolvable
    here at all: this table is header-local, and tree-sitter does not follow
    ``#include``, so it sees neither the tag spelling nor the declaration. That
    case keeps the C spelling and fails loudly.

    ``_struct_to_ctypes`` normally emits ``class <tag>``, so the work here is
    recognising the *other* ways that same record is spelled at a use site.
    libclang keeps C's elaborated form, so a member reaches the writer as
    ``struct Inner`` or ``union U``; a C++ record in a namespace is spelled
    ``n::Inner``, which matches neither.

    Unlike an enum, a record needs no width analysis and admits no default: the
    answer is the class this writer emits or there is no answer. A record the
    header does not declare -- one from an ``#include`` that tree-sitter never
    read, say -- is absent here and keeps its C spelling, which fails loudly
    rather than resolving to something invented.

    **A contested tag is mangled, not dropped.** Two things can want the bare
    name, and C gives each of them a different meaning:

    * two records whose namespaces differ (``a::Inner`` and ``b::Inner``), which
      flatten to one class name so the second would overwrite the first;
    * a record and an ordinary identifier (``struct Gauge { ... };`` beside
      ``typedef unsigned char Gauge;``), which are separate namespaces in C and
      mean an eight-byte record and a one-byte integer respectively.

    In both cases the record is emitted under a distinct class name and only its
    *unambiguous* spellings -- elaborated and qualified -- are mapped to it. The
    bare name is left to whatever else owns it: the typedef, resolved through
    :func:`_scalar_typedef_names`, or nothing at all when two records contest it,
    in which case it stays unbound and fails loudly. Every spelling then means
    what C says it means, and nothing that worked before stops working. One
    mechanism covers both collisions because they are one shape.

    The bare tag of an *uncontested* record maps to itself, which is a no-op. It
    is registered anyway rather than special-cased, because the lookup happens
    after ``CTYPES_TYPE_MAP``: a header may legally declare ``struct int8_t``

    #: after import. ``int _lib(void);`` is the same collision against the loader
    #: preamble, and destroys the library handle every later export reads from.

    #: reserved only when it is actually written. The preamble blocks contribute
    #: via :func:`module_level_bindings`, which reads the text actually emitted
    #: rather than a hand-kept list, so a block that starts binding a new name
    #: reserves it without a second list needing to be updated in step.

class CtypesWriter(BaseWriter):
    """Writer that generates Python ctypes binding modules from headerkit IR.

    Options
    -------
    lib_name : str
        Variable name for the loaded library object. Defaults to ``"_lib"``.
        Controls the variable name used in function prototype annotations
        (e.g., ``_lib.func.argtypes = [...]``).
    library : str
        Base name of the *native* library a scaffolded package loads, without a
        ``lib`` prefix or a platform suffix -- what ``ctypes.util.find_library``
        is given. This is not ``lib_name``, which names a Python variable.
        Defaults to the package name, which is right only when the two happen to
        coincide: scaffolding ``probe_bindings`` around ``libprobe`` needs
        ``library="probe"`` or the generated module cannot find its binary.
