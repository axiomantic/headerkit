"""Unnamed-bitfield padding must reach the ctypes writer and no other writer.

The ctypes writer reconstructs record layout itself, so it needs the reserved
bits. Every other writer emits source that a C compiler lays out from the
original declaration; a padding entry in that output would be a spurious member.

The rule lives in ``BaseWriter._prepare``, which each entry point must route
through. A writer that overrides ``write`` and forgets is the failure this
module exists to make loud -- otherwise the omission shows up as a nameless
member in generated source, which no other test would attribute to padding.
