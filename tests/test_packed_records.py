"""Packed-record support, measured against a compiled C probe.

Every layout figure asserted here was produced by compiling the corresponding
record with the host C compiler and reading the bits back out of a live object:
each field is set to all ones in an otherwise zeroed record and the set bits are
scanned. The expected values are literals so that a change in the writer or a
backend moves a test rather than silently moving the expectation with it.

Ground truth was taken on macOS arm64 (Apple clang, LP64). The records were
chosen so that every asserted figure is fixed by the Itanium C++ ABI's rules for
packing and bit-field allocation rather than by anything host-specific: all
member types are ``unsigned char``/``unsigned short``/``unsigned int``, whose
sizes are the same on every platform the project supports.
