"""Compile-link-execute gates for generated work-order tests.

A generated test file that merely *parses* proves almost nothing. ``compile()``
succeeds identically whether the package it imports works or raises ``NameError``
on its first line -- which is exactly how the importability defects this repo
carries managed to ship. These tests build a real C library, generate a project
against its header, and run the generated suite for real, asserting that Tier 1
passes and that the stubs fail.

**The generated suite alone does not reach the library, and cannot.** Tier 1 is
language-local by construction -- ``ord(CT_MODE_FAST)`` is a Nim enum constant and a
struct round-trip is a Nim field write -- and every Tier 2/3 stub calls ``fail()``
before it would call anything. ``importc`` is compile-time only, so a linker asked for
an object nobody references is satisfied by an object with no symbols in it. A gate
built on the generated suite alone therefore passes against an *empty* translation
unit, which is what this file used to do.

So each gate appends a driver that calls real functions through the generated bindings
module, and each has a negative control that rebuilds the native artifact from an empty
translation unit and requires the run to go red. The negative control is the load-bearing
part: a gate never observed failing for the right reason is a claim, not a mechanism.

Every toolchain check routes through ``tests.skip_policy``: under CI a missing tool
is a failure naming it, and only locally is it a skip. A toolchain check that quietly
no-ops when the compiler is absent proves nothing while looking green.
