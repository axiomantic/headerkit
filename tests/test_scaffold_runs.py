"""Execution gates for scaffolded packages: import them, compile them, call through them.

Every other scaffolding test in this suite asserts on the *text* of a generated
file. That is what let three un-importable packages ship: a test that greps
``_bindings.py`` for ``_lib.thing_add.argtypes`` passes identically whether the
module works or raises ``NameError`` on the line it just matched.

The gates here consume the output instead. A real C library is compiled from a
fixture header, the scaffolder is run against that same header, and the result
has to survive being used:

* the ctypes package must **import** and the call must reach the C function;
* the Nim package must **compile, link and execute** against the same library;
* the generated tests must themselves **run**, both of them;
* and with the native library absent both the package and its tripwire must
  **fail**, which is the tripwire invariant in ``AGENTS.md`` §1 -- a tripwire
  that passes without the binary present is a green mirage.

**These gates degrade to a silent no-op in two ways, and both are CI-only
properties rather than local ones.** ``_require`` skips the whole test when no
compiler is on PATH, so a machine without a toolchain reports green having
executed nothing; and ``tree-sitter`` is an optional extra, so on a plain
``pip install -e .[test]`` only the ``libclang`` parameter runs a body and the
``[tree-sitter]`` one reports a skip. A skip is visible in ``-rs`` output and
invisible in a bare exit status, which is the trap: "parameterized over both
backends" is true of CI, where both are installed, and is a claim about a local
run that has to be checked rather than assumed. Read the test ids, not the exit
status, when using these gates to judge a change. Making the skips loud would mean deciding
what a contributor without a C++ toolchain should see, which is a change to
every gate in this file and not one this file's newest additions should make
alone.

Every gate runs against each installed parser backend. The ``importc`` spelling
the Nim writer emits is chosen from ``is_typedef``, which the two backends
derive by different routes, so a gate bound to one backend would leave the other
one's output unproven.

The fixture header is the smallest one reaching every discrimination these gates
were written for. Each declaration earns its place:

``typedef enum { ... } Flags;``
    Tag-less. Declares no ``enum Flags``, so ``importc: "enum Flags"`` names an
    incomplete type, and ``Flags = Flags`` in ctypes raises ``NameError``. Its
    enumerators are written as plain integers rather than as ``1 << 3``: the
    tree-sitter backend passes such an initialiser through verbatim, and Nim
    spells that operator ``shl``, which is a separate defect this file is not
    the gate for.
``typedef enum { ... } Mode;``
    A second tag-less enum, so the first cannot pass by coincidence.
``typedef enum Mode2 { ... } Mode2;``
    Tagged, alias repeating the tag. ``enum Mode2`` really is declared here.
``enum Bare { ... };``
    A tag with no typedef at all: the bare name is *not* a type spelling.
``typedef struct { ... } Rec;``
    Tag-less, and carries a bit-field so the record's layout is exercised.
``typedef struct Foo { ... } FooAlias;``
    Tagged, alias differing from the tag -- the case where the tag must survive
    into the emitted C rather than being replaced by the alias.
``thing_add`` / ``rec_a`` / ``foo_a``
    Something to call. Two or more functions also make the generated test files
    multi-line, which is the shape that broke their indentation.

#: Every shape in which an enum can reach a record member or a function

#: ``Row``          an array of enum, where the spelling is composed into
#:                  ``Colour * 4`` and a bad element type is still a bad name
#: ``colour_next``  an enum as a parameter and as a return type, which is the

#: ``Shadowed``     the negative control. ``enum Tone`` and ``typedef struct
