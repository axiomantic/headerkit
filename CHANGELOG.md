## [Unreleased]

## [0.38.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- `ParserBackend.parse` and `LibclangBackend.parse` accept a keyword-only `whitelist` parameter naming files whose declarations are retained alongside the main file's. Previously every declaration reaching the translation unit through `#include` was discarded before any caller-side filter could see it, so whitelisting an included header yielded an empty body. Absolute entries are used as-is; relative entries (including a bare basename) resolve against the directory of the parsed file, then `include_dirs`, then the current working directory. The parameter defaults to `None`, so existing backends remain conformant.

### Fixed

- `LibclangBackend`: anonymous struct, union and enum declarations no longer leak clang's internal `struct (unnamed at file:line:col)` spelling into the IR. An anonymous tag is now named after the declarator that uses it (`struct { int a; } v;` becomes `_v_s`), falling back to a per-translation-unit counter slug (`_anon_struct_1`) when nothing references it, so output stays reproducible.
- `PxdWriter`: function pointer variables emitted an abstract declarator with the name appended (`void (*)(int, char) my_func`), which is not valid Cython. They are now emitted as a named `ctypedef` plus an alias declaration (`ctypedef void (*_my_func_ft)(int a, char b)` / `_my_func_ft my_func`).
- `LibclangBackend`: a named member whose type is an anonymous struct or union (`struct { int v; int g; } css;`) is no longer flattened into its parent as if it were a C11 anonymous member. Such a member has a declarator, so C11 6.7.2.1p13 does not apply; flattening dropped the member entirely, leaving `outer.css` unreachable, and emitted a bodyless `cdef struct` for its type. The anonymous type now gets its own bodied declaration named for the enclosing record (`_outer_css_s`), so two records may each hold a `css`. Genuine C11 anonymous members (`struct { int b; };` with no declarator) still flatten.
- `PxdWriter`: a function pointer variable's generated `ctypedef` and its alias declaration are now separated by a blank line, matching how the writer separates every other pair of declarations.
- `LibclangBackend`: pointers to unprototyped functions (`TypeKind.FUNCTIONNOPROTO`, e.g. `int (*f)()`) were converted to opaque types carrying raw clang spelling instead of function pointers.
- `LibclangBackend`: function pointer parameter names are recovered from the declaring cursor's `PARM_DECL` children for variables, struct fields and function parameters. Clang's function *type* carries no argument names, so these previously rendered as `(int, char)`.
- `LibclangBackend` / `PxdWriter`: C11 anonymous nested struct and union members are now captured on `Field.anonymous_struct` and flattened into the enclosing record by the Cython writer, instead of being dropped.
- `LibclangBackend`: a tagged struct or union *defined* inside another record body (`struct my_s { union my_nested_u { char c; int i; } n; };`) is now emitted as a top-level declaration ahead of the record that uses it. The nested definition was dropped entirely, so the writer saw only an undeclared tag and emitted a bare forward declaration; the containing struct then used that incomplete type by value, which Cython rejects with "Variable type 'my_nested_u' is incomplete". Nesting recurses innermost-first, so each level precedes the level that uses it. A tag introduced without a body (`struct node { struct peer *p; };`) still yields a forward declaration only, and C++ nested classes are unaffected.
- `PxdWriter`: a named pointer-to-function-pointer parameter (`void reg(void (**pxFunc)(int, char));`) kept its name outside the declarator (`void (**)(int, char) pxFunc`), which Cython rejects with "Expected ')'". Only single-level function-pointer parameters were routed through the declarator formatter; the star count now follows the pointer depth, so any depth renders as `void (**pxFunc)(int, char)`. Reduced from sqlite3's `xFindFunction`.
- `LibclangBackend`: enums declared inside a struct or union body are now emitted as top-level declarations, so fields referring to them no longer name an undeclared type. A named field whose type is an anonymous enum (`enum { X } e;`) is no longer misclassified as a transparent anonymous member.
- `PxdWriter`: removed the guard that silently discarded any enum whose name contained `(unnamed at`, which deleted top-level anonymous enums entirely.
- `PxdWriter`: a struct whose every member is filtered out now emits `pass` rather than a suite header with no body, which Cython rejects.
- `LibclangBackend`: tag-less typedef'd enums (`typedef enum { ... } Name;`) now set `Enum.is_typedef`, so the Cython writer emits `ctypedef enum Name` instead of `cdef enum Name`. The old output made Cython generate `enum Name x;`, which fails to compile against the header with "tentative definition has type 'enum Name' that is never completed". Tagged enums (`typedef enum Tag { ... } Tag;`) keep `cdef enum`, and C++ enums are unaffected.
- `CffiWriter`: enum/typedef pairs are combined into the tag-less `typedef enum { ... } Name;` form only when the enum really has no tag. A tagged `typedef enum Tag { ... } Tag;` now keeps its `enum Tag` tag instead of having it silently dropped.
- `LibclangBackend`: `project_prefixes` are matched against absolute, symlink-resolved paths instead of as substrings of clang's raw location spelling. Clang reports included files by their relative include path (e.g. `./foo.h`), so passing an absolute prefix previously never matched.
- `LibclangBackend`: the redundant self-referential `Typedef` produced alongside a `typedef enum` is now dropped during declaration deduplication, matching the existing `typedef struct` handling.
- `LibclangBackend`: `const` and `volatile` qualifiers are no longer dropped from pointers, elaborated types, records, enums and typedefs (`char* const`, `const my_struct*`, `const my_union* const`). The deliberate stripping of `_Atomic`, `__restrict` and `_Noreturn` is unchanged.
- `TreeSitterBackend`: pointee `const` is preserved in every declaration position -- struct and union fields, function parameters, return types, typedefs, global variables and type aliases. `const char*` previously parsed as `char*`, silently dropping the qualifier from generated bindings.
- `TreeSitterBackend`: pointer-level `const` on a function parameter (`char* const p`) is preserved instead of being discarded.
- `TreeSitterBackend`: a `whitelist` naming a file other than the one being parsed now raises `UserWarning` instead of being discarded silently, because this backend does not follow `#include` directives and cannot honor one. Entries that all resolve to the parsed file itself are already satisfied and warn nothing; resolution follows the same rule as the libclang backend.
- `PxdWriter`: synthesized forward declarations now carry the keyword-escape cname (`cdef struct class_ "class"`). Without it the generated C referenced a nonexistent `struct class_`.
- `PxdWriter`: a record referenced before its definition is emitted now gets a forward declaration, matching the reference output.
- `PxdWriter`: a keyword-named typedef no longer emits a bogus self-referential `ctypedef with_ with_ "with"`; the circular-typedef check now compares the bare escaped name rather than the cname-annotated spelling.
- `LibclangBackend`: a named function-pointer typedef (`typedef void (*cb_t)(int a, char *b, int c[3][4]);`) now recovers its parameter names from the declaring cursor's `PARM_DECL` children, as the struct-field and variable paths already did. The typedef path never reached that recovery, so the names were lost -- and with them the array extents, because the writer only spells an array parameter inside a named declarator. `int c[3][4]` therefore degraded to `int`, a weaker type than C's adjusted `int (*)[4]`.
- `LibclangBackend`: the generated tag for an anonymous enum declared inside a record is now qualified by the enclosing record's name (`_outer_x_e`), as anonymous struct and union tags already were. Two records each holding an anonymous-enum member named `x` both bound the tag `_x_e`, so the second record's member took the first's type and its own enumerators were emitted nowhere.
- `Pointer.__str__`: qualifiers on the pointer itself are now rendered after the `*` (`int* const`) instead of before the base type (`const int*`), which spelled a const pointer as a pointer to const. Nested pointers render each level's qualifiers at that level, so `Pointer(Pointer(CType("char", ["const"]), ["const"]), ["const"])` is `const char* const* const` rather than `const const const char**`. Pointee qualifiers are unaffected.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- Enhanced CShim writer (`CShimWriter`) with C++ inheritance flattening: emits upcast helpers (`{Derived}_as_{Base}`) using `static_cast` for proper pointer offset adjustment under multiple/virtual inheritance, and flattens public base class methods directly onto derived opaque handle APIs.
- Standard library container mappings in `CShimWriter`: `std::string` and `std::string_view` mapped to `const char*` with thread-safe C-string conversion; `std::vector<T>` parameters mapped to flat `(const T* data, size_t count)` C-ABI arrays and reconstructed into C++ vectors.
- Expanded operator mappings in `CShimWriter`: added conversion/cast operators (`operator bool`, `operator int`, etc. mapped to `to_bool`, `to_int`) and unary operator disambiguation (`operator*` to `deref`, `operator-` to `neg`, `operator+` to `pos`).

### Fixed

- Pipeline and registry wiring: added backend alias normalization (`treesitter` and `tree_sitter` to `tree-sitter`) across `get_backend()` and `is_backend_available()`; wired custom override `@hook("write_output")` execution into `generate()`; executed `transform_unit` hooks during `scaffold()`; forwarded CLI `--writer-opt` values to `ScaffoldOptions`; and completed `supported_options` declarations across Mojo, Ctypes, Cffi, Cython, and Nim writers.
- `CShimWriter`: rejected non-const `std::string&` and `std::string_view&` references from automatic C-string flattening, avoiding invalid C++ compilation when binding temporary rvalues to mutable references, and preserving opaque handle type safety.
- `CShimWriter`: fixed base class resolution in multiple inheritance flattening and upcast generation by tracking classes by fully-qualified name and scoped namespace lookup, preventing collisions between identical short class names across namespaces.
- Writer options type coercion: implemented `WriterOption.coerce` and `coerce_writer_options` in `BaseWriter`, `get_writer()`, and CLI `--writer-opt` parsing, properly coercing string inputs into declared types (e.g. `bool`, `int`, `float`).
- `CShimWriter`: replaced tautological `assert((void*)fn != NULL)` in generated C test harnesses with cross-platform runtime dynamic symbol resolution (`dlopen`/`dlsym` on POSIX, `GetProcAddress` on Windows) linked against `${CMAKE_DL_LIBS}`, eliminating green-mirage compiler-optimized assertions.
- `MojoWriter`: generated tripwire tests now compute exact Mojo FFI parameter and return type signatures for each foreign function symbol rather than hardcoding `fn() -> None`.
- Layout delegation: removed redundant `write()` method overrides in `MojoWriter`, `CShimWriter`, and `NimWriter`, properly inheriting `BaseWriter.write()` delegation to `write_layout(layout="file")` to satisfy the Zero-Dual-System Rule.
- `TreeSitterBackend`: fixed extraction of C variadic function declarations (`variadic_parameter` node type in tree-sitter C grammar), top-level variable declarations (pointers, multi-dimensional arrays, sized primitives, and multiple declarators per statement), struct callback function pointer fields, bitfield widths, and function pointer typedefs.
- Memory safety in `CShimWriter`: prevented dangling pointer / use-after-free when returning `std::string` by value by managing lifetime via thread-local C-string storage, and fixed `std::string_view` returns to avoid invalid `.c_str()` member invocations.
- Missing standard headers in `CShimWriter`: added `#include <stddef.h>` to generated C headers when `size_t` is present, and added `#include <vector>`, `<string>`, and `<cstddef>` to generated C++ implementation shims.
- Constrained `std::vector<T>` parameter flattening in `CShimWriter` to by-value and const references, preventing illegal binding of temporary rvalues to non-const references.
- Disambiguated overloaded C++ methods and free functions in `CShimWriter` with numeric suffixes rather than silently skipping subsequent overloads.
- Expanded cross-compilation compiler binary pattern matching in `headerkit._target` to support version-suffixed binaries (`gcc-12`, `gcc-14.2.0`), Windows `.exe`, and dotted target components (`darwin21.4`).
- Upgraded generated unit test stubs in `headerkit.packaging.nim` to assert function parameter counts and signatures via `inspect.signature` instead of shallow callable checks.
- Nim scikit-build wheel packaging template and build helpers (`headerkit.packaging.nim`, `generate_nim_cmake`, `generate_nim_pyproject`, `generate_nim_python_wrapper`, `generate_nim_source`, `generate_nim_wheel_layout`): end-to-end scaffolding for compiling Nim modules into distributable binary Python wheels via `scikit-build-core` with deterministic `--mm:orc` ARC runtime memory management, multi-platform library naming across Linux/macOS/Windows, idempotent `NimMain()` initialization, ctypes function wrappers, and non-tautological tripwires.
- Added `wheel` and `scikit-build` layout modes to `NimWriter` (`headerkit header.h -w nim --layout wheel`) with CLI support for compiling and packaging Nim-based native extensions into binary wheels.
- Structured `TargetTriple` dataclass and parsing (`headerkit.TargetTriple`, `parse_triple`): parses 3- and 4-component triples as well as 2-component shorthands (`x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-darwin`, `win64`, `wasm32-wasi`, `arm-none-eabi`) into structured target models with platform predicates (`is_windows`, `is_darwin`, `is_linux`, `is_musl`, `is_wasm`, `is_embedded`) and architecture-aware `pointer_width` (8 for 64-bit, 4 for 32-bit, 2 for 16-bit).
- Cross-compilation toolchain auto-detection (`detect_cross_compiler_target`): automatically detects active cross-compilation targets from `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`, `LLVM_TARGET_TRIPLE`, `CROSS_COMPILE`, and `CC`/`CXX` cross-compiler binary prefixes (e.g. `aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc`) in `resolve_target()`.
- C++ Tree-Sitter parser backend: enhanced `TreeSitterBackend` with `tree-sitter-cpp` support, enabling zero-system-dependency parsing of C++ headers (.hpp, .hh, .hxx, .cpptest) and `-x c++` inputs.
- C++ AST extraction in Tree-Sitter: support for extracting C++ classes (`cppclass`), member access specifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`), constructors, virtual/pure-virtual methods (`= 0`), static methods, const-qualified methods, destructors, base inheritance (`BaseSpecifier`), nested namespaces, class/function templates, using-declaration type aliases, reference types (`&` and `&&`), and operator overloads.
- Added `tree-sitter-cpp>=0.23` to `treesitter` optional dependency extra.

- Pipeline context layout filtering: added `layout` attribute to `PipelineContext` enabling hooks to match and filter on requested layout strategies (e.g. `@hook("scaffold_project", layout="package")`), with automatic fallback when a layout is unsupported by a specific writer.
- End-to-end roundtrip integration test coverage for all 10 writers: added `test_roundtrip_cshim.py`, `test_roundtrip_mojo.py`, and `test_roundtrip_nim.py` completing full `libclang` C/C++ AST-to-binding roundtrip verification across the entire writer surface.
- Writer-defined layouts and options introspection: added `WriterOption` dataclass and `supported_layouts` / `supported_options` attributes on `BaseWriter` and all 10 concrete writers, enabling writers to declare layouts (e.g. `file`, `package`, `project`, `cmake`) and configurable arguments (`test_type`, `catch_exceptions`, `indent`, `verbosity`). Added public discovery functions `list_writer_layouts(name)` and `list_writer_options(name)` with layout validation in `BaseWriter.write_layout()`.
- Unified output writer scaffolding architecture: all 10 writers (`ctypes`, `cffi`, `cython`, `luajit/lua`, `nim`, `mojo`, `cshim`, `json`, `diff`, `prompt`) inherit from `BaseWriter` and implement `write_layout(unit, options) -> ProjectLayout`, unifying single-file generation and multi-file package scaffolding under a single layout engine.
- Automatic scaffolder hook registration: `register_writer()` registers the `@hook("scaffold_project", writer=name, target=name)` hook, allowing all writers to transparently serve as scaffolding engines.
- Extended package scaffolding templates for Cython (`.pxd`, `.pyx`, `pyproject.toml`, tripwire), CFFI (`build_ffi.py`, `_bindings.py`, `pyproject.toml`, tripwire), CShim (`CMakeLists.txt`, headers, bridge source, test harness), and LuaJIT (rockspec, Lua source, tripwire).
- Legacy `writer.write(header)` backward-compatibility facade natively delegating to `write_layout(layout="file")`.
- Polyglot project and extension scaffolding engine (`headerkit.scaffold`): unified layout architecture where single-file bindings and full packages are driven by a single output model (`OutputFile`, `ProjectLayout`, `ScaffoldOptions`, `scaffold()`).
- Built-in zero-dependency standard library scaffolder (`StdlibScaffolder`) generating complete turnkey packages with build metadata and test suites for Nim (`.nimble`, `nim.cfg`), Mojo (`mojoproject.toml`), and Python (`pyproject.toml`).
- Pluggable `BYOScaffolder` protocol and `scaffold_project` hook integration for third-party template engines (e.g. Copier, Cookiecutter) with custom precedence.
- Dual test stub generation: automated side-by-side failing tripwires (`pytest-tripwire`, `nim-tripwire`) for C ABI symbol/library verification and unit test skeletons.
- TTY-aware dynamic wizard (`prompt_scaffold_options`) auto-detecting terminal status to guide users through package setup interactively, with graceful `--no-input` fallback.
- CLI options: `--layout` (`file`, `package`, `project`), `--package-name` / `--pkg`, `--test-type` (`both`, `tripwire`, `unit`, `none`), and `--no-input`.
- Executable Copier BYOScaffolder showcase example (`examples/scaffolding/copier_scaffolder.py`).
- Comprehensive scaffolding guide (`docs/guides/scaffolding.md`) and API reference (`docs/reference/scaffold.md`).
- Mojo FFI binding writer (`headerkit.writers.mojo`): generates idiomatic Modular Mojo bindings using `sys.ffi.DLHandle` and C-ABI flat shims, mapping C types, structs, enums, typedefs, constants, and high-level C++ class wrapper structs.
- Mojo writer reference documentation (`docs/reference/mojo.md`).
- C source definition parsing: enhanced `TreeSitterBackend` to extract non-static function definitions and declarations from `.c` source files.

### Removed

- Removed regex-based `RustBackend`, `ZigBackend`, and `NimBackend` source extractors. Regular-expression parsing of context-free languages is strictly prohibited; proper grammar-based AST extractors (via Tree-sitter grammars) are scheduled on the roadmap.

### Fixed

- Eliminated completion bias, hollow scaffolding, and tautological test generation across all writer packages:
  - `CShimWriter`: emit complete C-ABI function prototypes and opaque struct handles into `include/{pkg}_cshim.h` instead of hollow placeholders; updated C test harness to `#include` the generated header and assert non-null symbol pointers.
  - `CythonWriter`: replaced tautological `assert pkg is not None` with module inspection and package structure assertions.
  - `CffiWriter`: replaced vacuous assertions with FFI instance type and configuration checks.
  - `CtypesWriter`: replaced vacuous assertions with exported symbol `hasattr` checks and module verification.
  - `NimWriter`: replaced `check true` and echo tripwires with real `dynlib.loadLib` and `symAddr` symbol resolution and `check declared(...)` assertions.
  - `MojoWriter`: replaced `assert_true(True)` with `DLHandle.get_function` symbol verification and struct type assertions.
  - `LuaWriter`: replaced print stubs with `ffi.load` and symbol table verification.
  - `TreeSitterBackend`: fixed preprocessor conditional traversal to skip mutually exclusive `#elif`/`#else` branches when visiting `#if`/`#ifdef`, preventing duplicate or conflicting symbol extraction. Fixed `-x c` and `-std=c*` CLI override handling.
- `headerkit.backends.treesitter`: lightweight, zero-system-dependency parser backend using `tree-sitter-c` for parsing C headers without requiring system LLVM or `libclang`. Added support for nested preprocessor blocks (`#ifndef`, `#ifdef __cplusplus`) and pointer-return function prototypes.
- Comprehensive guide for Nim to Python packaging and deterministic memory management (`docs/guides/nim-python-packaging.md`) using `--mm:orc` and `scikit-build-core`.
- Real-world working example (`examples/nim_bridge/`) demonstrating compiled Nim library, Headerkit ctypes bindings, and binary wheel distribution.
- `treesitter` optional dependency extra in `pyproject.toml` (`pip install "headerkit[treesitter]"`).
- `headerkit.hooks` module implementing a unified hook architecture with priority tiers (`FALLBACK`, `STANDARD`, `PROJECT`, `OVERRIDE`), glob pattern matching, and `first_result` / `waterfall` dispatch modes.
- Exported hook symbols (`Priority`, `PipelineContext`, `HookImpl`, `HookRegistry`, `hook`, `HookDispatcher`, `HookCaller`, `execute_pipeline`) in top-level `headerkit` namespace.
- Core IR evolution: renamed `Header` to `SourceUnit` with `Header = SourceUnit` backward-compatibility alias, and added `InputSpec` for polyglot input classification.
- Unified backend and writer registry: migrated all 9 built-in writers and parser backends into `HookRegistry`, with `get_backend()` and `get_writer()` delegating to `HookDispatcher`.
- Enhanced `TreeSitterBackend` with recursive preprocessor block extraction, pointer return parsing, and void parameter handling.
- `execute_pipeline`: automated 3-stage execution pipeline (`parse_unit` -> `transform_unit` -> `write_output`) with context threading.
- Polyglot generator trunk migration: `generate()`, `generate_all()`, and `batch_generate()` accept `InputSpec` directly and route parsing through `parse_unit` and AST transformations through `transform_unit`.
- Added `runtime`, `language`, and `classification` parameters to `generate()`, `generate_all()`, `batch_generate()`, and `PipelineContext`.
- CLI `--runtime`, `--language`, and `--classification` options and corresponding `HEADERKIT_RUNTIME`, `HEADERKIT_LANGUAGE`, `HEADERKIT_CLASSIFICATION` environment variable overrides.
- `_load_hook_plugins()` for discovery and dynamic loading of third-party hook plugins via `headerkit.hooks` entry points.
- Cheap static capability discovery: `supported_languages` and `supported_classifications` declared on `ParserBackend` protocol, `TreeSitterBackend`, and `LibclangBackend`.
- Project `ROADMAP.md` defining strategic pillars and horizons (Now, Next, Later) for language integrations (Nim, Mojo), packaging templates, a unified priority/glob hook pipeline, polyglot input classification, `SourceUnit` IR evolution, and documentation sweeps.

## [0.19.2] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- Corrected test subprocess interception dependency distribution name from `python-tripwire` to `pytest-tripwire`. The package was renamed again upstream after 0.19.1 shipped; the import name (`tripwire`) and plugin proxy attribute (`tripwire.subprocess`) are unchanged. Test minimum is now `pytest-tripwire>=0.20,<1`.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-04-30

### Changed

The package was renamed upstream in 0.20.0 (2026-04-26); the import name is now `tripwire` (was `bigfoot`) and the plugin proxy attribute is `tripwire.subprocess` (was `bigfoot.subprocess_mock`). Test minimum is `python-tripwire>=0.20,<1`.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-04

### Changed

- CFFI writer default output extension changed from `.py` to `.cdef.txt` (output is C declarations, not Python)
- CFFI writer `hash_comment_format` now uses C89-compatible `/* */` comments instead of `#`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- `HEADERKIT_STORE_DIR` environment variable for configuring the store directory, enabling cibuildwheel integration where the store must reside on a host-visible mounted volume. Resolution order: explicit `store_dir` parameter > `HEADERKIT_STORE_DIR` env var > config file `store_dir` > auto-detect from project root.
- cibuildwheel integration guide: Docker volume mount pattern for persisting `.headerkit/` store on Linux builds

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- `headerkit store merge` CLI subcommand for combining platform-specific store directories into a single `.headerkit/` directory
- `store_merge()` Python API with `MergeResult` dataclass for programmatic store merging
- Merge logic handles IR entries (`ir/`), output entries (`output/<writer>/`), and `index.json` files
- Duplicate detection: entries with the same slug and cache_key are skipped; entries with the same slug but different cache_key are overwritten (later sources win)

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- `define_patterns` now resolves `#include` directives when `code=` is provided, scanning included files for matching macros (umbrella header pattern)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Environment variable expansion in config: `${VAR}` syntax in string values, with error on unset variables
- `define_patterns` CFFI writer option: regex-based macro extraction from raw header text, emitting `#define NAME ...` for CFFI compile-time resolution
- `extra_cdef` CFFI writer option: append literal cdef lines (e.g., `extern "Python"` callbacks) to generated output
- CFFI Build Integration documentation guide

## [0.15.1] - 2026-04-03

### Removed

- `action.yml` composite GitHub Action (use standard workflow with `peter-evans/create-pull-request` instead; see CI Store Population guide)

### Changed

- Renamed "GitHub Action" docs guide to "CI Store Population" with workflow examples using standard GitHub Actions building blocks

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Glob-based header selection: CLI positional args accept quoted glob patterns (e.g., `headerkit 'include/**/*.h'`)
- `[[tool.headerkit.headers]]` array-of-tables config for header selection with per-pattern overrides
- `--exclude` CLI flag for glob-based header exclusion
- `[tool.headerkit.output]` config section for per-writer output path templates
- Output path template variables: `{stem}`, `{name}`, `{dir}`
- `-o WRITER:TEMPLATE` CLI flag for per-writer output path templates
- `batch_generate()` public API for multi-header generation with fail-fast semantics
- `BatchResult` dataclass for batch generation results
- `resolve_headers()`, `resolve_output_path()`, `check_output_collisions()` public API functions
- `default_output_pattern` class attribute on all built-in writers
- GitHub Action (`action.yml`) for CI cache population

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Store directory renamed from `.hkcache/` to `.headerkit/`
- **Breaking:** IR schema version bumped from "2" to "3" (all existing cache entries invalidated)
- **Breaking:** `cache_dir` parameter renamed to `store_dir` in `generate()`, `generate_all()`, and `HeaderkitConfig`
- **Breaking:** `--cache-dir` CLI flag renamed to `--store-dir`
- **Breaking:** Config key `[tool.headerkit.cache].cache_dir` moved to `[tool.headerkit].store_dir`
- **Breaking:** `-w WRITER[:PATH]` syntax removed; use `-w WRITER` and `-o WRITER:TEMPLATE`
- **Breaking:** CLI positional args accept globs; quote patterns to prevent shell expansion
- **Breaking:** `WriterSpec.output_path` renamed to `WriterSpec.output_template`
- `find_cache_dir()` simplified to single-pass project-root-only lookup (no walk-up for existing directory)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- `detect_process_triple()` replaces `detect_host_triple()` with process-aware detection using `HOST_GNU_TYPE` (POSIX) or `sysconfig.get_platform()` (Windows)
- musl libc detection: correctly produces `linux-musl` triples on Alpine and other musl-based systems (via `os.confstr` sniff for pre-3.13 Python where `HOST_GNU_TYPE` may report `gnu` on musl)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `detect_host_triple()` removed; use `detect_process_triple()`
- Simplified target detection: one signal per platform instead of 5-step fallback chain. `HOST_GNU_TYPE` on POSIX, `get_platform()` on Windows. For cross-compilation, set `--target` explicitly.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Target triple support for cross-compilation: `generate(target="aarch64-apple-darwin")`
- `detect_host_triple()` and `resolve_target()` public API functions
- `--target` CLI flag for specifying target triple
- `HEADERKIT_TARGET` environment variable for target triple configuration
- `[tool.headerkit] target` config key in pyproject.toml
- Target triple included in cache directory slugs for readability
- `normalize_triple()` inserts `unknown` vendor for 3-component triples (e.g., `x86_64-linux-gnu` -> `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`)

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Cache keys now use LLVM target triple instead of `sys.platform` + `platform.machine()` + Python version. Existing `.hkcache/` entries will be regenerated on first use (IR schema version bumped to 2).
- **Breaking:** `compute_ir_cache_key()` requires `target` parameter instead of reading platform/arch at runtime
- **Breaking:** `PopulateTarget` uses `target_triple` field instead of `sys_platform`, `machine`, `py_impl`
- **Breaking:** `PLATFORM_MAP` values are target triple strings instead of `(platform, machine)` tuples
- **Breaking:** Removed `py_impl_for_version()` from `_populate` module
- Python version removed from IR cache key (IR represents parsed C declarations, not Python-specific output)
- `-target` flag automatically passed to libclang for correct cross-platform parsing
- Bump `bigfoot` test dependency minimum to 0.19

### Fixed

- Add positional-only parameter markers to vendored clang binding stubs (v18-v21) to fix stubtest failures

## [0.12.5] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Document `LibclangUnavailableError` in backends reference page
- Update `is_backend_available()` description in architecture guide to reflect real load test behavior
- Update build backend guide to reference `LibclangUnavailableError` instead of generic error

## [0.12.4] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- `LibclangUnavailableError` exception for clear error reporting when libclang cannot be found after all recovery attempts (auto-install, cache fallback)
- Deploy dev docs on every push to main (docs fixes go live immediately)
- CI warning when a PR is missing a version bump or changelog entry

### Fixed

- Auto-install now triggers correctly when libclang library is not found (was broken in 0.12.3 due to exception type mismatch between `RuntimeError` from `parse()` and the `ValueError` catch in `generate()`)
- Fix incorrect CLI command in install-libclang reference (`headerkit-install-libclang` -> `headerkit install-libclang`)
- Fix wrong default writer comment in generate reference (default is cffi, not json)
- Fix references to non-existent `Writer` base class in cache guide examples
- Fix broken relative doc links in README (use full docs site URLs)
- Fix LLVM version example in installation guide (17 -> 18, matching supported range)
- Update `site_description` in mkdocs.yml to mention all writers

### Changed

- `generate()` uses explicit `is_backend_available()` check instead of exception catching to detect missing libclang and trigger the output-cache fallback / auto-install flow
- `is_backend_available("libclang")` now performs a real library load test via `is_system_libclang_available()` instead of only checking whether the backend class is registered
- CI and install-libclang workflows now skip on docs-only changes via `paths-ignore`

## [0.12.3] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Removed `reload_backends()` from the public API. The libclang backend class is now always registered, and `_configure_libclang()` re-searches on every call (short-circuiting only when the library is already loaded). After `auto_install()` puts libclang on disk, the next `get_backend().parse()` call naturally finds it without any manual reload step.

### Fixed

- Linux: libclang search now includes versioned .so names (`libclang.so.18`, `libclang-18.so`) in RHEL/Fedora `/usr/lib64` and generic `/usr/lib` paths, not just the unversioned `libclang.so` from clang-devel
- Cross-platform: libclang search now checks the `clang/native/` directory from the PyPI `libclang` package (`pip install libclang`) as a fallback on all platforms
- Windows: `_configure_libclang()` now calls `os.add_dll_directory()` for the candidate DLL's directory before loading, so dependent DLLs (e.g. zlib, ncurses) can be found

## [0.12.2] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Corrected changelog: added missing release sections for v0.10.1, v0.11.0, and v0.12.0 that were previously lumped into [Unreleased]

## [0.12.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- Linux: `install_linux()` now tries the lighter `clang-libs` package before falling back to `clang-devel` on dnf-based distros (RHEL/AlmaLinux/manylinux_2_28)
- Windows x64: `_install_windows_x64()` now detects pre-installed LLVM at the default location before attempting Chocolatey, and configures PATH/`os.add_dll_directory()` so ctypes can find libclang.dll
- `auto_install()` now falls back to `pip install libclang` when platform-specific installation fails or the library is not loadable after install
- Backend registry caching bug: after `auto_install()` installs libclang at runtime, `get_backend("libclang")` now correctly discovers the newly available backend instead of returning the stale "no backends available" result
- `_find_project_root()` regression from cache populate PR: restored use of `absolute()` instead of `resolve()` to prevent Windows 8.3 short-name expansion
- Wired `load_populate_config()` defaults into `populate()` and CLI for platforms, python_versions, and timeout

## [0.12.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- `headerkit cache populate` CLI subcommand for generating cache entries across multiple target platforms using Docker containers
- `populate()` Python API with `PopulateResult` and `PopulateTarget` data types
- cibuildwheel config parsing (`--cibuildwheel`) for automatic target detection
- Per-platform Docker image configuration via `[tool.headerkit.cache.populate.images]`
- Dry-run mode (`--dry-run`) for previewing planned cache population targets

### Fixed

- `parse_cibuildwheel_config()` no longer emits spurious macOS/Windows warnings when those platforms are not in the build matrix (e.g., `build = "cp312-manylinux*"`)

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Opt-in auto-install of libclang when `generate()` needs to parse but the backend is unavailable, with layered configuration (highest precedence first):
  1. `generate(auto_install_libclang=True)` kwarg
  2. `HEADERKIT_AUTO_INSTALL_LIBCLANG=1` environment variable
  3. `auto_install_libclang = true` in `[tool.headerkit]` of pyproject.toml
  4. Default: disabled (opt-in)
- `auto_install()` function in `install_libclang` module for quiet, non-interactive libclang installation
- `headerkit.build_backend_auto` PEP 517 build backend that wraps `headerkit.build_backend` with auto-install enabled (sets `HEADERKIT_AUTO_INSTALL_LIBCLANG=1`)

### Changed

- Auto-install is now opt-in (default disabled) instead of opt-out. Projects that relied on the previous default-enabled behavior should set `HEADERKIT_AUTO_INSTALL_LIBCLANG=1` or use `headerkit.build_backend_auto` as their build backend.
- Replaced `HEADERKIT_NO_AUTO_INSTALL` env var with `HEADERKIT_AUTO_INSTALL_LIBCLANG` (set to `1` to enable)
- CI test matrix reduced to full Python range on Ubuntu only, with latest Python on macOS and Windows

### Fixed

- `_find_project_root()` no longer uses `Path.resolve()`, which on Windows can expand 8.3 short names and cause the `.git` marker walk to escape the intended project boundary, potentially triggering unwanted auto-install

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- `generate()` now falls back to the output cache when the backend (libclang) is unavailable, enabling the documented libclang-free build workflow

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Two-layer content-addressable cache store (`.hkcache/` directory)
- `generate()` and `generate_all()` public API for cache-aware header generation
- `json_to_header()` JSON IR deserializer (inverse of `header_to_json()`)
- `GenerateResult` dataclass for multi-writer generation results
- PEP 517 build backend (`headerkit.build_backend`) for consumer projects
- CLI flags: `--no-cache`, `--no-ir-cache`, `--no-output-cache`, `--cache-dir`
- Environment variables: `HEADERKIT_NO_CACHE`, `HEADERKIT_NO_IR_CACHE`, `HEADERKIT_NO_OUTPUT_CACHE`
- Cache subcommands: `headerkit cache status`, `headerkit cache clear`, `headerkit cache rebuild-index`
- `[tool.headerkit.cache]` configuration section in pyproject.toml
- Writer `cache_output` attribute for opt-out of output caching (diff, prompt writers)

### Changed

- CLI `main()` now delegates to `generate()` for cache-integrated pipeline

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Deduplicated README and removed premature autopxd2 mention

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Updated README: fixed project description, added Mermaid architecture diagram, listed supported output formats and plugin system
- Added CHANGELOG checklist item to PR template
- Bumped `actions/checkout` to v6, `actions/cache` to v5, `peter-evans/create-pull-request` to v8

### Fixed

- Test assertion for Homebrew detection was unconditional but the code only probes `brew` on macOS

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Updated bigfoot dependency to >=0.4.1 and adopted `with bigfoot:` context manager syntax
- Test suite now uses [bigfoot](https://github.com/axiomantic/bigfoot) for subprocess interception. `subprocess.run` and `shutil.which` mocks in `test_install_libclang.py`, `test_version_detect.py`, `test_libclang.py`, and `test_windows_detection.py` are replaced with `bigfoot.subprocess_mock`, which enforces strict FIFO ordering and fails fast on unexpected calls.
- Integration test writer assertions extracted into shared helpers (`_check_ctypes_write`, `_check_cython_write`, etc.) in `test_real_headers.py`, eliminating repeated assertion logic across the five library test classes.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-04

### Removed

- `headerkit-install-libclang` standalone console script. Use `headerkit install-libclang` instead.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Prompt writer incorrectly classified `typedef void (*fn)(int);` as a plain typedef in compact and standard modes when libclang represents the underlying type as `Pointer(FunctionPointer(...))`. Compact mode now emits `CALLBACK fn(...) -> void` and standard mode places it in the `callbacks:` section.
- Prompt writer cross-reference map built keys with `struct`/`union`/`enum` prefixes (e.g. `struct Config`) while declaration dicts use bare names (`Config`), so `used_in` was never populated. Keys are now normalized to bare names.
- Tautological writer tests: all 4 writer test files asserted `writer.write(h) == writer_function(h)`, which is always true since write() delegates to the function; replaced with specific output content assertions
- Tautological protocol checks: `isinstance(writer, WriterBackend)` only checks attribute names exist on runtime-checkable Protocol; replaced with behavioral verification in all writer test files
- Integration writer tests used `len(output) > 0` as sole assertion; replaced with known-symbol checks in all 10 cffi/json writer integration tests
- `test_version_detect.py` patched `shutil.which` in the wrong namespace (global instead of `headerkit._clang._version`), making the mock ineffective; test passed by coincidence
- `test_ensure_backends_loaded_handles_import_error` had a broken patch target and asserted a flag that was set unconditionally before the import; fixed with `sys.modules` sentinel and registry-empty assertion
- `test_verify_libclang_success/failure` had a dead `@patch` decorator with `create=True` on a nonexistent attribute and never verified the target function was called; removed dead patch, added `assert_called_once()`
- `test_dict_is_json_serializable` asserted `json.loads(json.dumps(x)) == x`, which is always true for JSON-native dicts; replaced with structural verification
- `test_loader.py` used `hasattr` as sole assertion for module attributes; replaced with `inspect.isclass` checks
- `test_pypy_compat.py` `test_value_property` was an exact duplicate of `test_init_with_string`; deleted
- Macro tests used permissive `or` (accepting int or str) and conditional `if` guards that passed silently when features were absent; resolved type ambiguity and pinned behavior assertions
- `test_negative_integer_macro` comment stated `value is None` but never asserted it; added the assertion
- `test_install_linux_apt` truncated command assertions to first 2-3 tokens, missing package names; now asserts full commands
- `test_install_windows_arm64` had self-referential path assertion comparing `call_args` to itself; replaced with computed expected path
- `test_ir.py` `test_pointer_with_qualifiers` docstring incorrectly described output as `int * const` when actual output is `const int*`; fixed docstring
- `test_ir.py` used substring checks (`"packed" in str(s)`, `"stdcall" in str(f)`) instead of exact equality; replaced with exact string assertions
- `test_public_api.py` `test_type_aliases_are_unions` checked union membership but not completeness; replaced with exact set equality assertions
- `test_diff.py` `test_format_description_property` used disjunctive assertion unlike every other writer test; replaced with exact string match
- `test_ctypes.py` `test_type_map_completeness` used magic number `len(MAP) == 28`; replaced with full key set assertion
- `test_ctypes.py` `test_section_headers_present` checked ordering of 4 of 5 sections, missing "Typedefs"; added
- `test_cython.py` `test_basic_cppclass` accepted both spaces and tabs via `or`; pinned to 4-space indentation matching source
- Integration `conftest.py` caught bare `except Exception` in all 6 download fixtures; narrowed to `urllib.error.URLError`, `socket.timeout`, `OSError`
- Integration `_parse_header` used `pytest.skip` for parse failures on known-good headers; changed to `pytest.fail`
- `test_roundtrip.py` conditional assertions (`if version_constants:`, `if switch_td:`) replaced with pinned behavior assertions
- Five duplicate `skip_if_no_libclang` autouse fixtures across test_libclang.py classes consolidated into one module-level fixture
- Redundant `CIR_CLANG_VERSION` env cleanup across 21 test methods replaced with module-level autouse fixture in test_version_detect.py
- Repeated `mock_winreg` constant setup across 6 test methods extracted into shared fixture in test_windows_detection.py

### Added

- `headerkit` CLI command: parse C headers and emit output via configurable writers (`headerkit input.h`, `headerkit -w cffi:out.h -w json:out.json input.h`)
- `headerkit install-libclang` subcommand: installs libclang system packages (delegates to `headerkit-install-libclang`)
- `--backend` flag to select parser backend (default: `libclang`)
- `-I` / `--include-dir`, `-D` / `--define`, `--backend-arg` flags for backend configuration
- `-w WRITER[:OUTPUT]` flag for writer selection and output routing; multiple writers supported; omitting output path sends to stdout
- `--writer-opt WRITER:KEY=VALUE` flag for per-writer constructor options; multiple flags accumulate list values
- `--config PATH` and `--no-config` flags for config file control
- Config file support: `.headerkit.toml` (preferred) and `[tool.headerkit]` section in `pyproject.toml`, discovered by walking up from the current directory
- Entry-point plugin discovery: install third-party backends/writers and register them under `headerkit.backends` or `headerkit.writers` entry-point groups
- `plugins` config key for explicit plugin module imports
- Multi-input file support via synthetic umbrella header with automatic prefix filtering
- `toml` optional dependency group (`pip install headerkit[toml]`) for TOML config support on Python 3.10
- Integration roundtrip tests for ctypes, Cython, Lua, prompt, and diff writers: full `libclang → IR → writer output` pipeline coverage for each writer, exercising structs, enums, functions, typedefs, constants, anonymous types, and empty headers.
- Integration smoke tests for all seven writers against real-world library headers (sqlite3, zlib, lua, curl, SDL2) in `test_real_headers.py`.
- `test_unknown_declaration_kind` for JSON writer's `"unknown"` fallback path (previously untested code path)
- `test_identical_functions/structs/enums_produce_no_diff` verifying unchanged declarations produce zero diff entries
- `test_field_added_in_middle_is_breaking` for struct diff edge case (middle insertion vs end append)
- `test_is_umbrella_header_system_headers_excluded` verifying system header filtering in umbrella detection
- `test_mixed_declarations` split into per-verbosity tests for better failure diagnosis in prompt writer

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- `get_backend_info()` always reported backends as `available: True` due to tautological check; now attempts instantiation to determine real availability
- Integration test fixtures silently swallowed all download exceptions, causing the entire integration suite to report green with zero assertions; fixtures now emit warnings on failure
- `_parse_header` test helper caught overly broad `Exception`, masking parser regressions as skipped tests; narrowed to `RuntimeError`
- Clang loader fallback tests did not verify which version module was loaded, allowing wrong-version regressions to survive
- Windows clang detection tests did not verify constructed file paths, allowing path construction bugs to survive
- `test_anonymous_struct_skipped` in ctypes writer contained a tautological assertion that could never fail
- `test_output_is_valid_json` serialized 6 declaration types but never verified any content
- `test_mixed_declarations` in prompt writer ran 3 modes x 7 declarations but only checked output was non-empty

### Added

- Macro parsing test coverage: integer, hex, negative, string, and function-like macro tests for the libclang backend (~190 lines of previously untested production code)
- Forward-declaration-to-definition replacement test for libclang backend
- `_ensure_backends_loaded` error handling and lazy loading tests
- Complex pattern roundtrip tests: bitfield structs, array-in-struct fields, nested structs
- Minimum declaration count assertions for real-world header integration tests (sqlite3, zlib, lua, curl, SDL2)
- Type-aware symbol verification in integration tests (checks declaration kind, not just name)
- JSON roundtrip count consistency checks (writer output count must match parse result)
- Invalid `CIR_CLANG_VERSION` env var fallthrough test
- Union member verification for `TypeExpr` and `Declaration` public API type aliases
- Registry cardinality and content checks for Cython type registries
- Anonymous declaration skip test for diff writer
- Variable integration test for Lua writer
- `--skip-verify` flag test and package manager fallthrough test for install_libclang
- PROVENANCE file hash verification in vendor tests

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- macOS cross-architecture: `ValueError: Unknown backend: 'libclang'` when an x86_64 process (e.g. cibuildwheel x86_64 test phase on Apple Silicon) finds an arm64-only Homebrew libclang first; `_configure_libclang` now iterates through all candidate paths instead of giving up after the first architecture-incompatible dylib fails to load

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Windows x64: `LibclangError: function 'clang_getFullyQualifiedName' not found` when system LLVM is older than the vendored v21 bindings; disable cindex compatibility check so unused functions are silently skipped
- Windows x64: `install_libclang` now pins the Chocolatey LLVM version to match the vendored bindings instead of installing whatever default Chocolatey provides
- macOS CI: `ValueError: Unknown backend: 'libclang'` in test environments where libclang is bundled inside a versioned Xcode app bundle (e.g. `Xcode_16.2.app`); added xcrun-based discovery and glob for versioned Xcode paths
- Missing `concurrency` groups on six GitHub Actions workflows (auto-tag, check-llvm, check-python, docs, pre-commit-autoupdate, release)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `.pyi` type stubs for all vendored clang bindings (v18-v21), enabling mypy to type-check code that uses vendored clang modules
- CI stubtest gate: `mypy.stubtest` validates that `.pyi` stubs match the runtime API of each vendored version, blocking merges on mismatch
- Pre-commit autoupdate workflow (`.github/workflows/pre-commit-autoupdate.yml`): weekly automated PRs to update pre-commit hook versions
- Auto-vendor workflow: `check-llvm.yml` now opens PRs with vendored code and copied stubs when new LLVM versions are detected (falls back to issues on failure)
- Vendoring script (`scripts/vendor_clang.py`): downloads cindex.py, writes PROVENANCE, copies nearest version's stubs, updates `VENDORED_VERSIONS`
- Unit tests for the vendoring script (`tests/test_vendor_clang.py`)

### Changed

- Removed mypy exclude for vendored clang directories; mypy now uses `.pyi` stubs instead of ignoring vendored code entirely

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- README incorrectly claimed "zero runtime dependencies" when libclang is a required system dependency; clarified to "zero Python package dependencies"
- `Function.__str__` now places calling convention after return type (`int __stdcall__ foo()` not `__stdcall__int foo()`)
- `is_typedef` in JSON writer now only included when `True`, consistent with other boolean flags

### Added

- Auto-tag GitHub Action: automatically creates version tags when `pyproject.toml` version changes on main, triggering the release pipeline

### Changed

- Extract duplicated clang.exe version detection into `_get_version_from_clang_exe()` helper
- Use `normalize_path()` in Windows search path tests instead of manual string replacement
- Strengthen test assertions for const qualifiers on pointer types and cimport line detection

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `stub_cimport_prefix` parameter for CythonWriter/PxdWriter: configurable stub cimport generation (e.g., `from autopxd.stubs.stdarg cimport va_list`)
- Comprehensive Cython type registry tests (17 tests)
- Additional Cython writer tests: full-text output assertions, pointer/array formatting, stub cimport integration (30 tests)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `Field.bit_width` IR field for C bitfield support
- `Field.anonymous_struct` IR field for anonymous nested struct/union members
- `Struct.is_packed` IR field for `__attribute__((packed))` structs
- `Function.calling_convention` and `FunctionPointer.calling_convention` IR fields
- CtypesWriter: generates complete Python ctypes binding modules
- CythonWriter: generates Cython .pxd declaration files with C++ support (ported from autopxd2)
- DiffWriter: generates API compatibility reports in JSON or Markdown format
- PromptWriter: generates token-optimized IR output for LLM context (compact/standard/verbose)
- LuaWriter: generates LuaJIT FFI binding files

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- PyPy support: compatibility shim for `c_interop_string` that avoids `c_char_p` subclassing
- End-to-end integration tests for JSON writer pipeline (18 new roundtrip tests)
- Real-world library header tests: sqlite3, zlib, lua, libcurl, SDL2, CPython (21 tests)
- CI caching for downloaded test headers
- `download` pytest marker for tests requiring network access
- Unit tests for PyPy compatibility monkey-patch (20 tests)

### Changed

- Renamed package from `clangir` to `headerkit` (`pip install headerkit`)
- Console script renamed from `clangir-install-libclang` to `headerkit-install-libclang`

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- CI workflow to test `headerkit-install-libclang` across Linux, macOS, and Windows

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `headerkit-install-libclang` CLI tool for automated platform-specific libclang installation
- Console script entry point (`headerkit-install-libclang`) in pyproject.toml
- Documentation guide and API reference for the install tool
- Support for Linux (dnf, apt-get, apk), macOS (Homebrew), Windows x64 (Chocolatey), and Windows ARM64 (direct LLVM download)

### Fixed

- `install_libclang` verification result was ignored, now returns exit code 1 on verification failure
- Narrowed broad `except Exception` to `(ImportError, OSError, RuntimeError)` in verification

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Mermaid diagrams in documentation: pipeline flowcharts and IR class hierarchies

### Fixed

- JSON export tutorial incorrectly listed `is_union` as a JSON output field
- Quickstart guide showed wrong pointer spacing (`char *` vs `char*`)
- `header_to_cffi` docstring converted from Google-style to Sphinx-style for mkdocstrings

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Pluggable writer protocol (`WriterBackend`) mirroring the existing backend registry pattern
- Writer registry with `register_writer()`, `get_writer()`, `list_writers()`, `is_writer_available()`, `get_default_writer()`, `get_writer_info()`
- `CffiWriter` class wrapping `header_to_cffi()` with self-registration as default writer
- `JsonWriter` with `header_to_json()` and `header_to_json_dict()` for full IR serialization
- Public API re-exports for all writer protocol symbols in `headerkit.__init__`
- MkDocs documentation site with Material theme and mkdocstrings autodoc
- 6 API reference pages auto-generated from docstrings
- 6 guide pages: installation, quickstart, architecture, CFFI usage, custom backends, custom writers
- 4 tutorial pages: PXD writer, ctypes writer, JSON export, C header cleanup
- Versioned documentation via mike with version selector dropdown
- GitHub Pages deployment workflow triggered on tagged releases
- `docs` optional dependency group in pyproject.toml

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Windows platform support: LLVM version detection via registry and Program Files scan
- Windows system header detection (`_get_windows_system_headers()`)
- Windows DLL search paths for libclang loading
- Python 3.14 support
- Weekly `check-python.yml` workflow for Python pre-release compatibility
- Full Windows CI in test matrix (ubuntu, macos, windows x Python 3.10-3.14)

### Fixed

- Three test failures on Windows CI (path separators, platform-specific mocks)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- IR data model: `Header`, `Function`, `Struct`, `Enum`, `Typedef`, `Variable`, `Constant`, and type expressions (`CType`, `Pointer`, `Array`, `FunctionPointer`)
- Pluggable backend registry with `ParserBackend` protocol, `register_backend()`, `get_backend()`, `list_backends()`
- Libclang backend extracted from autopxd2 with LLVM 18-21 support
- CFFI cdef writer (`header_to_cffi()`) extracted from pynng
- Vendored clang Python bindings (`cindex.py`) for LLVM 18, 19, 20, 21
- LLVM version auto-detection: env var, llvm-config, pkg-config, clang preprocessor, `/usr/lib/llvm-N/`, Homebrew
- Public API re-exports in `headerkit.__init__`
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions test matrix, lint (ruff + mypy), release workflow with PyPI trusted publishing
- Pre-commit hooks for ruff, mypy, and standard checks
- LLVM license compliance for vendored bindings
