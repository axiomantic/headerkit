and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Hash-based cache staleness detection for generated output files
- `compute_hash()`, `save_hash()`, and `is_up_to_date()` public API functions in `headerkit.cache`
- `is_up_to_date_batch()` for checking multiple outputs at once
- `cache-check` CLI subcommand (exit 0 = up-to-date, exit 1 = stale)
- `cache-save` CLI subcommand for saving hash metadata
- Embedded TOML hash comments for cffi, ctypes, cython, and lua writers
- Sidecar `.hkcache` files for json, prompt, and diff writers
- `hash_comment_format()` method on CffiWriter, CtypesWriter, CythonWriter, and LuaWriter
- Python 3.10 support with `tomli` fallback for TOML parsing

## [0.8.4] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Deduplicated README and removed premature autopxd2 mention

## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Updated README: fixed project description, added Mermaid architecture diagram, listed supported output formats and plugin system
- Added CHANGELOG checklist item to PR template
- Bumped `actions/checkout` to v6, `actions/cache` to v5, `peter-evans/create-pull-request` to v8

### Fixed

- Test assertion for Homebrew detection was unconditional but the code only probes `brew` on macOS

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-05

### Changed

- Updated bigfoot dependency to >=0.4.1 and adopted `with bigfoot:` context manager syntax
- Test suite now uses [bigfoot](https://github.com/axiomantic/bigfoot) for subprocess interception. `subprocess.run` and `shutil.which` mocks in `test_install_libclang.py`, `test_version_detect.py`, `test_libclang.py`, and `test_windows_detection.py` are replaced with `bigfoot.subprocess_mock`, which enforces strict FIFO ordering and fails fast on unexpected calls.
- Integration test writer assertions extracted into shared helpers (`_check_ctypes_write`, `_check_cython_write`, etc.) in `test_real_headers.py`, eliminating repeated assertion logic across the five library test classes.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-04

### Removed

- `headerkit-install-libclang` standalone console script. Use `headerkit install-libclang` instead.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Prompt writer incorrectly classified `typedef void (*fn)(int);` as a plain typedef in compact and standard modes when libclang represents the underlying type as `Pointer(FunctionPointer(...))`. Compact mode now emits `CALLBACK fn(...) -> void` and standard mode places it in the `callbacks:` section.
- Prompt writer cross-reference map built keys with `struct`/`union`/`enum` prefixes (e.g. `struct Config`) while declaration dicts use bare names (`Config`), so `used_in` was never populated. Keys are now normalized to bare names.
- Tautological writer tests: all 4 writer test files asserted `writer.write(h) == writer_function(h)`, which is always true since write() delegates to the function; replaced with specific output content assertions
- Tautological protocol checks: `isinstance(writer, WriterBackend)` only checks attribute names exist on runtime-checkable Protocol; replaced with behavioral verification in all writer test files
- Integration writer tests used `len(output) > 0` as sole assertion; replaced with known-symbol checks in all 10 cffi/json writer integration tests
- `test_version_detect.py` patched `shutil.which` in the wrong namespace (global instead of `headerkit._clang._version`), making the mock ineffective; test passed by coincidence
- `test_ensure_backends_loaded_handles_import_error` had a broken patch target and asserted a flag that was set unconditionally before the import; fixed with `sys.modules` sentinel and registry-empty assertion
- `test_verify_libclang_success/failure` had a dead `@patch` decorator with `create=True` on a nonexistent attribute and never verified the target function was called; removed dead patch, added `assert_called_once()`
- `test_dict_is_json_serializable` asserted `json.loads(json.dumps(x)) == x`, which is always true for JSON-native dicts; replaced with structural verification
- `test_loader.py` used `hasattr` as sole assertion for module attributes; replaced with `inspect.isclass` checks
- `test_pypy_compat.py` `test_value_property` was an exact duplicate of `test_init_with_string`; deleted
- Macro tests used permissive `or` (accepting int or str) and conditional `if` guards that passed silently when features were absent; resolved type ambiguity and pinned behavior assertions
- `test_negative_integer_macro` comment stated `value is None` but never asserted it; added the assertion
- `test_install_linux_apt` truncated command assertions to first 2-3 tokens, missing package names; now asserts full commands
- `test_install_windows_arm64` had self-referential path assertion comparing `call_args` to itself; replaced with computed expected path
- `test_ir.py` `test_pointer_with_qualifiers` docstring incorrectly described output as `int * const` when actual output is `const int*`; fixed docstring
- `test_ir.py` used substring checks (`"packed" in str(s)`, `"stdcall" in str(f)`) instead of exact equality; replaced with exact string assertions
- `test_public_api.py` `test_type_aliases_are_unions` checked union membership but not completeness; replaced with exact set equality assertions
- `test_diff.py` `test_format_description_property` used disjunctive assertion unlike every other writer test; replaced with exact string match
- `test_ctypes.py` `test_type_map_completeness` used magic number `len(MAP) == 28`; replaced with full key set assertion
- `test_ctypes.py` `test_section_headers_present` checked ordering of 4 of 5 sections, missing "Typedefs"; added
- `test_cython.py` `test_basic_cppclass` accepted both spaces and tabs via `or`; pinned to 4-space indentation matching source
- Integration `conftest.py` caught bare `except Exception` in all 6 download fixtures; narrowed to `urllib.error.URLError`, `socket.timeout`, `OSError`
- Integration `_parse_header` used `pytest.skip` for parse failures on known-good headers; changed to `pytest.fail`
- `test_roundtrip.py` conditional assertions (`if version_constants:`, `if switch_td:`) replaced with pinned behavior assertions
- Five duplicate `skip_if_no_libclang` autouse fixtures across test_libclang.py classes consolidated into one module-level fixture
- Redundant `CIR_CLANG_VERSION` env cleanup across 21 test methods replaced with module-level autouse fixture in test_version_detect.py
- Repeated `mock_winreg` constant setup across 6 test methods extracted into shared fixture in test_windows_detection.py

### Added

- `headerkit` CLI command: parse C headers and emit output via configurable writers (`headerkit input.h`, `headerkit -w cffi:out.h -w json:out.json input.h`)
- `headerkit install-libclang` subcommand: installs libclang system packages (delegates to `headerkit-install-libclang`)
- `--backend` flag to select parser backend (default: `libclang`)
- `-I` / `--include-dir`, `-D` / `--define`, `--backend-arg` flags for backend configuration
- `-w WRITER[:OUTPUT]` flag for writer selection and output routing; multiple writers supported; omitting output path sends to stdout
- `--writer-opt WRITER:KEY=VALUE` flag for per-writer constructor options; multiple flags accumulate list values
- `--config PATH` and `--no-config` flags for config file control
- Config file support: `.headerkit.toml` (preferred) and `[tool.headerkit]` section in `pyproject.toml`, discovered by walking up from the current directory
- Entry-point plugin discovery: install third-party backends/writers and register them under `headerkit.backends` or `headerkit.writers` entry-point groups
- `plugins` config key for explicit plugin module imports
- Multi-input file support via synthetic umbrella header with automatic prefix filtering
- `toml` optional dependency group (`pip install headerkit[toml]`) for TOML config support on Python 3.10
- Integration roundtrip tests for ctypes, Cython, Lua, prompt, and diff writers: full `libclang → IR → writer output` pipeline coverage for each writer, exercising structs, enums, functions, typedefs, constants, anonymous types, and empty headers.
- Integration smoke tests for all seven writers against real-world library headers (sqlite3, zlib, lua, curl, SDL2) in `test_real_headers.py`.
- `test_unknown_declaration_kind` for JSON writer's `"unknown"` fallback path (previously untested code path)
- `test_identical_functions/structs/enums_produce_no_diff` verifying unchanged declarations produce zero diff entries
- `test_field_added_in_middle_is_breaking` for struct diff edge case (middle insertion vs end append)
- `test_is_umbrella_header_system_headers_excluded` verifying system header filtering in umbrella detection
- `test_mixed_declarations` split into per-verbosity tests for better failure diagnosis in prompt writer

## [0.7.3] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- `get_backend_info()` always reported backends as `available: True` due to tautological check; now attempts instantiation to determine real availability
- Integration test fixtures silently swallowed all download exceptions, causing the entire integration suite to report green with zero assertions; fixtures now emit warnings on failure
- `_parse_header` test helper caught overly broad `Exception`, masking parser regressions as skipped tests; narrowed to `RuntimeError`
- Clang loader fallback tests did not verify which version module was loaded, allowing wrong-version regressions to survive
- Windows clang detection tests did not verify constructed file paths, allowing path construction bugs to survive
- `test_anonymous_struct_skipped` in ctypes writer contained a tautological assertion that could never fail
- `test_output_is_valid_json` serialized 6 declaration types but never verified any content
- `test_mixed_declarations` in prompt writer ran 3 modes x 7 declarations but only checked output was non-empty

### Added

- Macro parsing test coverage: integer, hex, negative, string, and function-like macro tests for the libclang backend (~190 lines of previously untested production code)
- Forward-declaration-to-definition replacement test for libclang backend
- `_ensure_backends_loaded` error handling and lazy loading tests
- Complex pattern roundtrip tests: bitfield structs, array-in-struct fields, nested structs
- Minimum declaration count assertions for real-world header integration tests (sqlite3, zlib, lua, curl, SDL2)
- Type-aware symbol verification in integration tests (checks declaration kind, not just name)
- JSON roundtrip count consistency checks (writer output count must match parse result)
- Invalid `CIR_CLANG_VERSION` env var fallthrough test
- Union member verification for `TypeExpr` and `Declaration` public API type aliases
- Registry cardinality and content checks for Cython type registries
- Anonymous declaration skip test for diff writer
- Variable integration test for Lua writer
- `--skip-verify` flag test and package manager fallthrough test for install_libclang
- PROVENANCE file hash verification in vendor tests

## [0.7.2] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- macOS cross-architecture: `ValueError: Unknown backend: 'libclang'` when an x86_64 process (e.g. cibuildwheel x86_64 test phase on Apple Silicon) finds an arm64-only Homebrew libclang first; `_configure_libclang` now iterates through all candidate paths instead of giving up after the first architecture-incompatible dylib fails to load

## [0.7.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- Windows x64: `LibclangError: function 'clang_getFullyQualifiedName' not found` when system LLVM is older than the vendored v21 bindings; disable cindex compatibility check so unused functions are silently skipped
- Windows x64: `install_libclang` now pins the Chocolatey LLVM version to match the vendored bindings instead of installing whatever default Chocolatey provides
- macOS CI: `ValueError: Unknown backend: 'libclang'` in test environments where libclang is bundled inside a versioned Xcode app bundle (e.g. `Xcode_16.2.app`); added xcrun-based discovery and glob for versioned Xcode paths
- Missing `concurrency` groups on six GitHub Actions workflows (auto-tag, check-llvm, check-python, docs, pre-commit-autoupdate, release)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `.pyi` type stubs for all vendored clang bindings (v18-v21), enabling mypy to type-check code that uses vendored clang modules
- CI stubtest gate: `mypy.stubtest` validates that `.pyi` stubs match the runtime API of each vendored version, blocking merges on mismatch
- Pre-commit autoupdate workflow (`.github/workflows/pre-commit-autoupdate.yml`): weekly automated PRs to update pre-commit hook versions
- Auto-vendor workflow: `check-llvm.yml` now opens PRs with vendored code and copied stubs when new LLVM versions are detected (falls back to issues on failure)
- Vendoring script (`scripts/vendor_clang.py`): downloads cindex.py, writes PROVENANCE, copies nearest version's stubs, updates `VENDORED_VERSIONS`
- Unit tests for the vendoring script (`tests/test_vendor_clang.py`)

### Changed

- Removed mypy exclude for vendored clang directories; mypy now uses `.pyi` stubs instead of ignoring vendored code entirely

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- README incorrectly claimed "zero runtime dependencies" when libclang is a required system dependency; clarified to "zero Python package dependencies"
- `Function.__str__` now places calling convention after return type (`int __stdcall__ foo()` not `__stdcall__int foo()`)
- `is_typedef` in JSON writer now only included when `True`, consistent with other boolean flags

### Added

- Auto-tag GitHub Action: automatically creates version tags when `pyproject.toml` version changes on main, triggering the release pipeline

### Changed

- Extract duplicated clang.exe version detection into `_get_version_from_clang_exe()` helper
- Use `normalize_path()` in Windows search path tests instead of manual string replacement
- Strengthen test assertions for const qualifiers on pointer types and cimport line detection

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `stub_cimport_prefix` parameter for CythonWriter/PxdWriter: configurable stub cimport generation (e.g., `from autopxd.stubs.stdarg cimport va_list`)
- Comprehensive Cython type registry tests (17 tests)
- Additional Cython writer tests: full-text output assertions, pointer/array formatting, stub cimport integration (30 tests)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- `Field.bit_width` IR field for C bitfield support
- `Field.anonymous_struct` IR field for anonymous nested struct/union members
- `Struct.is_packed` IR field for `__attribute__((packed))` structs
- `Function.calling_convention` and `FunctionPointer.calling_convention` IR fields
- CtypesWriter: generates complete Python ctypes binding modules
- CythonWriter: generates Cython .pxd declaration files with C++ support (ported from autopxd2)
- DiffWriter: generates API compatibility reports in JSON or Markdown format
- PromptWriter: generates token-optimized IR output for LLM context (compact/standard/verbose)
- LuaWriter: generates LuaJIT FFI binding files

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- PyPy support: compatibility shim for `c_interop_string` that avoids `c_char_p` subclassing
- End-to-end integration tests for JSON writer pipeline (18 new roundtrip tests)
- Real-world library header tests: sqlite3, zlib, lua, libcurl, SDL2, CPython (21 tests)
- CI caching for downloaded test headers

- Unit tests for PyPy compatibility monkey-patch (20 tests)

### Changed

- Renamed package from `clangir` to `headerkit` (`pip install headerkit`)
- Console script renamed from `clangir-install-libclang` to `headerkit-install-libclang`

## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- CI workflow to test `headerkit-install-libclang` across Linux, macOS, and Windows

## [0.3.2] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Documentation guide and API reference for the install tool
- Support for Linux (dnf, apt-get, apk), macOS (Homebrew), Windows x64 (Chocolatey), and Windows ARM64 (direct LLVM download)

### Fixed

- `install_libclang` verification result was ignored, now returns exit code 1 on verification failure
- Narrowed broad `except Exception` to `(ImportError, OSError, RuntimeError)` in verification

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Mermaid diagrams in documentation: pipeline flowcharts and IR class hierarchies

### Fixed

- JSON export tutorial incorrectly listed `is_union` as a JSON output field
- Quickstart guide showed wrong pointer spacing (`char *` vs `char*`)
- `header_to_cffi` docstring converted from Google-style to Sphinx-style for mkdocstrings

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- Pluggable writer protocol (`WriterBackend`) mirroring the existing backend registry pattern
- Writer registry with `register_writer()`, `get_writer()`, `list_writers()`, `is_writer_available()`, `get_default_writer()`, `get_writer_info()`
