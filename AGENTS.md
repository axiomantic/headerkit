## Changelog

Keep `CHANGELOG.md` up to date using [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Every user-facing change should have a changelog entry.

## Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Bump the version in `pyproject.toml` whenever creating a branch that changes shipped code. A branch touching only documentation -- anything under `docs/`, plus `mkdocs.yml` and any root-level `*.md` -- does not bump, and does not release. That is the same set `ci.yml` ignores, so the rule and the pipeline stay in step as files are added:

- **Major** (X.0.0): Breaking changes to public API
- **Minor** (0.X.0): New features, new public API surface
- **Patch** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, internal refactors, and documentation shipped alongside a code change

## Vendored clang bindings

`headerkit/_clang/` contains vendored upstream clang Python bindings for LLVM 18-23. These are excluded from ruff and mypy. Do not modify, refactor, or lint them.

## Registry pattern & unified hooks

Backends and writers use the unified hook engine (`headerkit.hooks`) as their underlying registry, preserving the managed circular import pattern for self-registration. Both `headerkit/backends/__init__.py` and `headerkit/writers/__init__.py` lazily import their concrete modules via `_ensure_*_loaded()`, and each concrete module self-registers via hooks and `register_backend`/`register_writer` at the bottom of the file. Do not restructure these imports.

When adding a new backend or writer, follow the pattern: define the class, register hooks on `parse_unit`/`get_backend` or `write_output`/`get_writer`, and call `register_*()` at the bottom of the module file.

## Strict prohibition against regex-based AST extraction (CANNOT REGEX FOR CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMARS)

**NEVER use regular expressions to parse, tokenize, or extract Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures from source code in context-free or structured programming languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig, Nim, etc.).**

Context-free grammars cannot be parsed by regular languages. Attempting to extract function declarations, type definitions, structs, interfaces, or language scopes with regex is fundamentally flawed and strictly forbidden:
- It fails on nested braces, generic type parameters, closures, macro invocations, block comments, multiline attributes, and string literals.
- It produces fragile green mirages—tests that pass on trivial happy-path snippets while failing on any non-trivial real-world syntax.

All parser backends and AST extractors in HeaderKit **MUST** use formal parser grammars or compiler toolchains:
- **Tree-sitter grammars** (e.g. `tree-sitter-c`, `tree-sitter-cpp`, `tree-sitter-rust`, `tree-sitter-zig`) traversing concrete syntax trees.
- **Compiler frontend ASTs** (e.g. LLVM `libclang`).
- **Formal compiler / AST bindings** provided by the language ecosystem.

Any code introducing regex-based AST extraction, source scanning, or signature scraping will be rejected immediately.

## Strict prohibition against deciding from a type spelling (WRITERS DO NOT GUESS)

The section above forbids recovering structure from source text with a regex, because a regular language cannot parse a context-free one. This section forbids the same error one layer later, after the parse has succeeded: the writer holds a real IR, and decides by pattern-matching a **name string** anyway. That rule governs *extraction*; this one governs *decision*. They are the same principle and are sited together for that reason.

**A writer must never decide from a type spelling. If the IR cannot answer the question, the fix is to record the fact in the IR, not to write a cleverer predicate.**

This is absolute rather than a default because a C or C++ header is *formally specified*. Every property a writer needs is stated in the grammar or derivable from it, exactly; there is no noise to smooth over and no sampling error to tolerate. A guess is therefore never the best answer available -- it is a refusal to go and get an answer that already exists. When a writer reaches for one, the question was asked in the wrong place: at the writer, where only a shadow of the fact survives, instead of at the backend, where the fact was in hand and thrown away. "It works on most headers" is a sentence about weather, not about a parser.

The checks below decide any concrete case.

**Before writing a predicate over a name**, ask whether two declarations that must produce different bindings can reach it spelled identically. In C and C++ the answer is yes far more often than it looks: tags and ordinary identifiers occupy separate namespaces, `using namespace` erases qualification, typedefs rename anonymous records, and a macro can expand two different declarations onto one spelling before a backend ever sees them. Where the answer is yes, **no refinement of that predicate can ever be correct**, because the distinguishing information is absent from its input. Stop and go record the fact at the backend.

**While maintaining an existing predicate**, treat a second correction in the opposite direction as a verdict. One widened because it missed cases and then narrowed because it caught too many is not mistuned -- **it is answering a question its input cannot express.** A third round is how the wrong answer becomes permanent, because by then the tests have been shaped around the predicate's blind spots.

When the fact genuinely is unavailable, refuse loudly and specifically. Unknown must be a distinct state from every real answer, and it must never resolve to a default that happens to look plausible.

The instances below are what these checks cost this codebase before anyone applied them, each one a pull request and several review rounds:

- `Enum.underlying_type` / `Enum.underlying_type_known` (fixed). The ctypes writer sized an enum from its enumerator values, and `enum E : unsigned char` came out four bytes against a real one. Two rounds refined the predicate first -- `is_scoped`, which was never the property that mattered, then an enumerator-range test that an empty enumerator list made vacuously true -- before the two fields were added.
- `CType.is_elaborated` (fixed). The writer could not tell `struct Gauge` from a bare `Gauge`. C keeps tags and ordinary identifiers in separate namespaces, so both are legal in one unit and name different types; tree-sitter strips the aggregate keyword, so before the flag existed the two *names* arrived identical and neither could be resolved. Both backends now record the flag while the keyword is still in hand -- the tree-sitter backend reads it off the token list before that list is stripped, precisely because afterwards it is unrecoverable -- and the writer branches on it. The distinction has to be recorded at the parser or not at all.
- `SourceUnit.language` (still open). The field exists, defaults to `"c"`, and is **never populated** -- while both backends compute the answer internally (`_is_cpp_mode`, `_detect_cplus`) and discard it at the `Header(...)` that returns. The measurement forecloses "just write a better heuristic": under `LibclangBackend`, `void f(std::string s);` in a `.hpp` and `typedef struct { int x; } string; void f(string s);` in a `.h` both reach a writer as `CType(name='string', qualifiers=[], is_elaborated=False)`, byte-identical, and both units report `language='c'`. Under `TreeSitterBackend` the same collision needs only `using namespace std;`.
- Tri-state flattening downstream (fixed, and mechanically pinned). A recorded "unknown" is worth only what the whole path preserves. `underlying_type_known` was collapsed to its `True` default by the JSON serialiser, and again by a cache entry written before the field existed, turning a refusal back into a wrong width through a door the writer cannot watch. `_IR_SCHEMA_VERSION` in `_cache_key.py` exists for exactly this and must move whenever an IR field is added.

The lesson each teaches: **a default that cannot be distinguished from "nobody recorded this" is a bug.** Unknown needs its own state, every serialiser and cache on the path must carry that state, and a consumer facing it refuses rather than resolves.

Corollaries:

- **Two independent predicates for one fact will drift, silently** (still open). Derive one from the other, or both from a single recorded value. The ctypes writer already carries two normalisations of "does this name already mean something else" -- `_typedef_aliases_its_own_tag` strips a `struct `/`union ` prefix to compare a typedef against its target, while `_enum_type_names` withholds by unprefixed name -- and the disagreement mapped a type onto a helper whose declaration had been withheld.
- **Model nothing the real engine can be asked** (fixed). A model of an allocator or a layout algorithm is a second implementation, and it drifts from the first. Independent axes make a writer-side bit-field model untenable, and they are separate hazards. By **platform**: ctypes selects among System V, AAPCS64 and MSVC layout rules, and any writer-side model encodes exactly one -- the same declaration is laid out at three different sizes across them. By **interpreter version**: off Windows, the ctypes layout engine changed in 3.14, so a model calibrated against an earlier interpreter is silently wrong on a later one. The writer now builds the record and reads back what the engine actually did rather than predicting it.

## Anti-completion bias & anti-green-mirage discipline

Completion bias is the failure mode where an agent rushes to check off roadmap items or satisfy the test runner by introducing superficial happy-path implementations, hollow file skeletons, or vacuous assertions that cannot fail. All code and tests must uphold the following non-negotiable invariants:

### 1. Zero tautological or vacuous assertions in generated code
Generated test suites (tripwires, unit tests) emitted by scaffolders, writers, or templates **MUST NEVER** emit tautologies:
- **Strictly prohibited**: `assert True`, `assert_true(True)`, `check true`, `assert True == True`.
- **Strictly prohibited**: `echo "Verifying symbol..."` or `print(...)` without assertions or error handling.
- **Strictly prohibited**: Superficial module existence checks (e.g. `assert mod is not None` on an imported module object) as the sole assertion.
- **Tripwire invariant**: A tripwire's purpose is to fail immediately if the native dynamic library binary is missing or if foreign C ABI entry points fail to link/resolve. A tripwire that passes when the native library is absent is a green mirage and is strictly forbidden.
- **Unit test invariant**: Generated unit test stubs must exercise the generated API: construct wrapper types, invoke wrapper functions, or assert that function signatures match expected parameters and return types.

**One narrow carve-out applies to both this section and section 2**, for the
deliberately failing stubs emitted by `headerkit/workorder.py`. It is stated in
full after section 2; read it before "fixing" a generated stub.

### 2. No hollow scaffolding (complete interface artifacts)
Scaffolding engines and layout writers must never emit placeholder or hollow files:
- **Headers must declare interfaces**: Never emit empty headers with comments like `// See implementation for details`. Header files (`.h`, `.hpp`, `.pxd`) must contain full function prototypes, struct definitions, enum definitions, and opaque handles.
- **Test harnesses must test**: Test harnesses (such as C test runners or CMake test targets) must include the generated header, link against the generated shared library, and execute at least one entry point. Never emit dummy stubs like `int main(void) { return 0; }`.
- **Packaging manifests must configure builds**: Manifests (`CMakeLists.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `*.nimble`, `*.rockspec`) must specify real compiler flags, include directories, and link libraries necessary to build the target.

### Carve-out: work-order stubs (sections 1 and 2)

**The exemption is attached to the failing construct, not to a file path.** Sections 1
and 2 do not apply to a stub generated by `headerkit/workorder.py` **for as long as it
fails**. A stub edited to pass is an ordinary test from that moment and is fully subject
to sections 1 and 2. Scoping the exemption to `tests/test_workorder.py` and
`tests/test_workorder.nim` as *files* would license replacing `pytest.fail(...)` with
`assert True` -- exactly the artifact section 1 forbids, in a path section 1 no longer
reached.

A generated stub calls `pytest.fail(...)` in Python, and `checkpoint(...)` followed by
`fail()` in Nim, and those are sanctioned.

**The distinguishing property is that they FAIL LOUDLY AND SAY WHY.** What section 2
forbids is scaffolding that *looks finished and is not* -- a hollow file that reports
success while testing nothing. A work-order stub is the exact opposite: it is red from
the moment it is generated, it names the specific work outstanding in its failure
message, and it carries the signature under test plus a definition of done. Red-to-green
is the intended progress meter, and the transition is meant to be earned: the sentence
above is what governs a stub that goes green without earning it.

The carve-out does not license:
- a stub that passes, or that asserts a tautology, in place of failing;
- a stub emitted for behaviour Tier 1 already tests completely (Tier 1 is defined in
  [`docs/guides/work-orders.md`](docs/guides/work-orders.md));
- deleting a stub, or making it pass with a vacuous assertion, to get a green run.

The Tier 1 tests emitted alongside them are ordinary generated tests and remain fully
subject to sections 1 and 2: they must assert real values derived from the IR.

**A future agent reading section 2 literally will be tempted to "fix" these stubs by
deleting them or making them pass. Do not. That destroys the work order.**

### 3. Consumption validates (testing the generators)
Tests that verify code generators, writers, and scaffolders must follow the "Consumption Validates" rule:
- **No path-presence-only testing**: Asserting `assert "filename" in paths` or `assert len(layout.files) > 0` is strictly insufficient. Tests must inspect the contents of every generated file to verify that declarations, symbols, types, and compiler flags are present.
- **Negative controls**: Tests must verify that invalid inputs, missing options, or unsupported layouts fail with descriptive exceptions rather than silently succeeding.
- **Compilation verification where available**: Whenever the target toolchain is installed in the local environment (Python, Clang/GCC, Cython, Nim), integration tests must compile or execute the generated output to prove validity.

### 4. Language grammar semantics (no mutually exclusive branch merging)
Parsers and AST extractors must respect language grammar semantics:
- **Preprocessor mutual exclusion**: Never blindly walk all branches of conditional preprocessor directives (`#if`, `#ifdef`, `#elif`, `#else`). Extracting declarations from mutually exclusive branches creates conflicting or duplicate IR representations.
- **Scope integrity**: Declarations inside classes, namespaces, or local scopes must reflect their enclosing scope in the IR; never flatten inner symbols into the global namespace without proper qualification.

### 5. Zero dead prototype residue
Before declaring any task complete:
- Clean up all prototype imports (`import re`, unused variables, debug prints, commented-out experiments).
- Ensure linters and typecheckers run without unreferenced imports.

## Architectural coherence & anti-islanding (Phase 0 scope gate)

Before writing code or tests for any task, perform an explicit Phase 0 scope audit:

- **Zero-Dual-System Rule**: When introducing a new engine, pipeline, or abstraction, existing built-in components must immediately adopt it in the foundational PR. Never build a new subsystem as an isolated island alongside the legacy mechanism it was designed to replace.
- **Foundational Noun Priority**: When core IR containers, domain models, or input classifications evolve (e.g. `Header` $\rightarrow$ `SourceUnit`, `InputSpec`), establish the new nouns in the base PR so new features are never built on deprecated models.
- **Consumer Trace**: Verify that standard callers (`get_backend()`, `get_writer()`, CLI) transparently flow through the new architecture rather than requiring special-case entry points.

## Public API

`headerkit/__init__.py` defines `__all__` with the full public surface. Backends and writers are accessed via registry functions (`get_backend()`, `get_writer()`), not by importing concrete classes directly. When adding new public symbols, add them to both the imports and `__all__` in `__init__.py`.

## Quality gates

All code must pass before committing:

- `ruff check .` and `ruff format --check .`
- `mypy --strict` on `headerkit/`
- `pytest` across Python 3.10-3.14 on Linux, macOS, and Windows

Pre-commit hooks enforce these automatically.

## Testing

Registry tests (`test_backends/test_registry.py`, `test_writers/test_registry.py`) must save and restore global registry state via fixtures. Each test should see a clean registry to prevent test pollution.

Tests requiring a system libclang installation use the `@pytest.mark.libclang` marker.

## Multi-line string literals

Use `textwrap.dedent` with a triple-quoted string instead of concatenating fragments with `+` and `"\n"`. Use an `f`-string prefix for interpolation. The backslash after the opening `"""` suppresses the leading newline.

```python
# Preferred
import textwrap

assert output == textwrap.dedent(f"""\
    {_PREAMBLE}
    # ========================
    # Typedefs
    # ========================

    callback_fn = ctypes.CFUNCTYPE(None, ctypes.c_int)
""")

# Avoid
assert output == (
    _PREAMBLE
    + "\n"
    + "# ========================\n"
    + "# Typedefs\n"
    + "# ========================\n"
    + "\n"
    + "callback_fn = ctypes.CFUNCTYPE(None, ctypes.c_int)\n"
)
```

This applies anywhere a multi-line string literal appears: assertions, expected-value variables, template strings, error messages.

## Runtime dependencies

The project has one conditional runtime dependency: `tomli` for Python 3.10 (before `tomllib` was added to stdlib). All other functionality is zero-dependency. If a feature needs an external package, make it an optional dependency with graceful degradation when absent.
